## About Me ðŸŒŸ

In my past life I was a value-driven developer, I specialize in both frontend and backend technologies. I excel in debugging and am proactive in identifying and solving problems, contributing to the robust and efficient execution of projects throughout the entire software lifecycle.In the realm of technology, I boast proficiency in an array of front-end frameworks, notably React and Angular. When it comes to mobile development, I wield expertise in cross-platform solutions, particularly React Native and Capacitor. On the back-end landscape, my skill set extends to Node.js, augmented by a nuanced understanding of Domain-Driven Design. Unwaveringly committed to best practices, I consistently deliver code that is not only clean and maintainable but also rigorously tested, regardless of the technology stack in play.
