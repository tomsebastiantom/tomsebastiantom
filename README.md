## 🧙‍♂️ Who am I? (Your Friendly Neighborhood Code Wizard)

I'm a **Senior Full Stack Developer** who transforms pizza 🍕 and curiosity into clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Think of me as the Swiss Army knife 🛠️ of web and mobile development—crafting seamless experiences from frontend finesse to backend brilliance.

Whether it's wrangling React state, mastering Angular magic, engineering Node.js APIs, or diving deep into Domain-Driven Design, my coding adventures span the entire technology stack. My superpower? Debugging mysterious production bugs until they regret ever showing up. 🐛🔨
